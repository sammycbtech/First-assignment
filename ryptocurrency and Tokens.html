<h2>What Gives CryptoCurrency Its Value?</h2>
<p>A cryptocurrency’s value is derived from a mix of factors — utility, scarcity, demand, and trust in the network that supports it. Unlike traditional fiat currencies backed by governments, cryptocurrencies gain value when users believe in their usefulness and when there’s real demand for the token. This utility can come from being used as a medium of exchange, powering decentralized applications, or granting governance rights in a blockchain ecosystem. <br>

    Additionally, scarcity plays a crucial role. Many cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have a limited supply, which can make them more valuable as demand increases. Market perception, community support, and technological innovation also shape how much people are willing to pay for a crypto asset. In essence, a cryptocurrency’s value is a balance between its economic function, technological foundation, and market psychology.</p>
