<h2>DECENTRALIZED FINANCE</h2>


Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a financial system built on blockchain technology that removes the need for traditional intermediaries such as banks, brokers, or exchanges. Instead, it uses smart contracts — self-executing programs that run on decentralized networks like Ethereum — to enable peer-to-peer financial transactions.

DeFi allows users to lend, borrow, trade, and earn interest on digital assets in a transparent and permissionless way. Because all transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, DeFi promotes greater accessibility and reduces barriers to entry compared to traditional finance. However, it also comes with risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainty.
