<h2>What are Stablecoins and How do They Work?</h2>

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by pegging their price to an external asset, most commonly a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. They combine the transparency and efficiency of blockchain with the price stability of traditional money, making them useful for trading, payments, and storing value in volatile markets. Stablecoins achieve this stability through different mechanisms â€” some are backed by real-world reserves (like USDT or USDC), others use over-collateralized crypto assets (like DAI), and a few rely on algorithmic systems that automatically adjust supply and demand. By minimizing volatility, stablecoins serve as a crucial bridge between the traditional financial system and the crypto economy.

<h2>Trading Stablecoins Against Altcoins</h2>  
Trading stablecoins against <a href="Altcoins.html">altcoins</a> allows investors to take advantage of market volatility while managing risk. Because stablecoins maintain a steady value, they act as a safe base currency that traders use to enter or exit positions in more volatile cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, or Avalanche. When altcoin prices fall, moving funds into stablecoins helps preserve portfolio value; when prices rise, traders can easily convert stablecoins back into altcoins to capture profits. This trading strategy provides liquidity and flexibility without the need to convert holdings back to fiat currency, making stablecoin pairs such as USDT/BTC or USDC/ETH among the most popular and efficient markets on crypto exchanges.
